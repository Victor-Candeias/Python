    "When exploring data, one of the most important things we can do is visualize it so we can better understand it. Like the popular saying \"*A picture is worth a thousand words*‚Äù, visualizations are sometimes more useful than summary statistics in helping us understand our data. This is because visualizations are a great tool for asking and answering questions about data. Depending on the type of question we are trying to answer, there are four major types of visualizations we could use. They are relationship, distribution, comparison and composition. By the end of this tutorial, you will have learned: \n",

    "Like the popular saying, \"a picture is worth a thousand words.\" Visualizations are sometimes more useful than summary statistics in helping us understand our data. One of the most popular visualization packages in Python is a matplotlib package, which provides a host of powerful functions and methods that allow us to produce publication quality visualizations. The plot method of a Pandas dataframe provides an abstraction of the matplotlib functions. To ensure that the plots we create in this tutorial appear right after our code, we have to run the following command."
