# The controller/__init__.py file in a Python project is typically used to mark the directory controller as a Python package. Here’s what you might include in such a file and its common purposes:

# Package Initialization: By including an __init__.py file, you enable Python to treat the controller directory as a package. This allows you to import modules from this directory using the package syntax.

# Code Initialization: You might put initialization code in __init__.py if you want to run some code when the package is imported. This could include setting up package-level variables or importing certain modules for convenience.

# Module Imports: You can use __init__.py to expose specific modules or functions to the package’s namespace. For example, if you want to make it easier to import certain components directly from the controller package, you could add import statements like:

from controller.output_job_controller import OutputJobController
from controller.input_job_controller import InputJobController

# Create a global instance of the OutputJobController
output_job_controller = OutputJobController()
input_job_controller = InputJobController()
